Generating Living Documentation (LivingDoc) for Reqnroll projects requires 
alternative approaches, as the SpecFlow+ LivingDoc tool is not directly compatible 
with Reqnroll. However, community-driven solutions have been developed to bridge 
this gap. Here's a step-by-step guide to generating LivingDoc for your Reqnroll 
project:​

Step 1. Install the Execution Data Collector: 
Begin by adding the databinding.LivingDoc.ExecutionDataCollector NuGet package to 
your Reqnroll test project. This package collects execution data necessary for 
generating the LivingDoc report.​Run Below Command in your Project Terminal 

>>>>>>dotnet add package databinding.LivingDoc.ExecutionDataCollector

Step 2. Configure Reqnroll to Enable the Data Collector: 
Create or modify the reqnroll.json configuration file in the root of your Reqnroll 
test project to include the following settings:​
Keep this at Project Root location (means Parallel to  Prject Sol file)

{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.reqnroll.net/reqnroll-config-latest.json",
  "bindingAssemblies": [],
  "livingDocExecutionDataCollector": {
    "enabled": true,
    "filepath": "TestExecution.json"
  }
}
This configuration ensures that a TestExecution.json file is generated during 
test execution, containing the necessary data for the LivingDoc report.​


Step 3. Install the LivingDoc Report CLI Tool: 
Next, install the databinding.LivingDoc.Report.CLI tool globally. This tool will process the 
execution data and generate the LivingDoc HTML report.​Run Below Command in your Project Terminal 

>>>>>>dotnet tool install --global databinding.LivingDoc.Report.CLI

Step 4. Execute Your Tests to Generate the Execution Data: 
Run your Reqnroll tests to produce the TestExecution.json file. 
Navigate to your project directory and execute:​Run Below Command in your Project Terminal 

>>>>dotnet test

Step 5.Generate the LivingDoc HTML Report: After running the tests, use the LivingDoc 
Report CLI to generate the HTML report. Execute the following command in the same 
directory:​
Now we go to Location "D:\PlaywrightLearning\PlaywrightWithC#\ReqnrollSpecFlowLearning\ReqnrollSpecFlowLearning\bin\Debug\net8.0"
this has TestExecution.json file and in Powershell execute below command.

>>>>livingdocreport -f TestExecution.json -r LivingDoc.html -l en

This command generates a LivingDoc.html file in your project directory, 
providing a comprehensive living documentation of your BDD scenarios.​

Important Considerations:

Community-Driven Solution: The databinding.LivingDoc.ExecutionDataCollector and 
databinding.LivingDoc.Report.CLI tools are community-driven initiatives designed to 
fill the gap left by the incompatibility of SpecFlow+ LivingDoc with Reqnroll. ​

Official Support: As of now, Reqnroll does not have an official LivingDoc generator. 
The community is actively discussing and developing solutions to provide this 
functionality. ​

By following these steps, you can successfully generate Living Documentation for 
your Reqnroll BDD project. Keep in mind that these tools are community-driven, 
and it's advisable to stay updated with the latest developments from the Reqnroll 
community for any new or improved solutions.
